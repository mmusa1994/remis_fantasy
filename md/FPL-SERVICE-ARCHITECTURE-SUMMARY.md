# FPL Service Architecture Restructure - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive restructuring of the Fantasy Premier League (FPL) API architecture in the Next.js application. The changes implement a clean, scalable service-oriented architecture with proper abstraction layers, type safety, and enterprise-level error handling and caching.

## Architecture Changes

### 1. New Service Structure (`/src/services/fpl/`)

  - High-level convenience methods

### 2. Enhanced Type System (`/src/types/fpl.ts`)

Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces covering:

#### Core Data Types
- `FPLBootstrapResponse` - Complete bootstrap data structure
- `FPLPlayer` - Detailed player information with all statistics
- `FPLTeam` - Team data including strength ratings
- `FPLGameweek` - Gameweek information and status
- `FPLFixture` - Match data and statistics

#### Service Response Types
- `FPLServiceResponse<T>` - Standardized service response
- `FPLPaginatedResponse<T>` - Paginated data response
- `FPLServiceConfig` - Service configuration options

### 3. Error Handling System (`errors.ts`)

Implemented robust error handling with custom error classes:

- `FPLAPIError` - API communication errors
- `FPLServiceError` - Service-level errors
- `FPLCacheError` - Cache-related errors
- `FPLValidationError` - Input validation errors

### 4. Caching Strategy

Advanced caching system with:
- **Configurable TTL**: Different cache durations for different data types
- **Stale While Revalidate**: Serve cached data while fetching fresh data
- **Request Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate simultaneous requests
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cache cleanup and size monitoring
- **Cache Statistics**: Detailed metrics for monitoring and optimization

### 5. API Route Modernization

Updated existing API routes to use the new service architecture:

#### Updated Routes
- `/api/fpl/manager-info` - Now uses `FPLTeamService`
- `/api/fpl/leagues/classic` - Enhanced with `FPLLeagueService`

#### Benefits of Updated Routes
- Consistent error handling and response format
- Built-in caching and performance optimization
- Type-safe data handling

- **Scalability**: High - modular, independently scalable services

#### 3. **Alternative: Repository Pattern**
- **Pros**: Clean data access layer, testable
- **Cons**: Overkill for API consumption, less flexible caching
- **Assessment**: Not optimal for this use case

#### 4. **Alternative: Custom Hooks Only**
- **Pros**: React-specific, component-level caching
- **Cons**: Client-side only, limited server-side optimization
- **Assessment**: Insufficient for enterprise requirements

const manager = await fplService.team.getManagerInfo(123456);

// Get league standings
const league = await fplService.league.getClassicLeagueStandings(314, 1);

// Get live scores
const liveData = await fplService.live.getCurrentLiveData();
```

### Advanced Usage
```typescript
// Get comprehensive manager overview
const overview = await fplService.getManagerOverview(123456);

// Compare multiple teams
const comparison = await fplService.team.compareTeams([123456, 789012]);

// Monitor service health
const health = await fplService.healthCheck();
```
